Where to send stories, event descriptions, screenshots, memes, and anything else you think is worth including in the documentation? How do I notify the historian?

You have a few options:

* Twitter - tag in comments or send a DM to the official CT History profile:
  * [@history\_of\_ct](https://twitter.com/history\_of\_ct)
* Twitter - tag in comments send a DM directly to the CT Historian:
  * [@always\_kind\_man](https://twitter.com/always\_kind\_man)
* Send it by email to:
  * historian.ct@gmail.com
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/N5Tcx3yVPk) - ping or send a DM to CT Historian:
  * always\_kind\_man#4463

[Discord](https://discord.gg/N5Tcx3yVPk) will be a place where we all discuss and review this documentation.

Just by discussing in the Discord channels, you will also really help. There is a high chance that many fragmented stories will be completed this way.
