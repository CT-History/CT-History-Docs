# âœ… Rules

Restoring the memories and documenting all these events will be fun, but we need to establish some ground rules:

{% hint style="danger" %}
No doxxing. That is the line you do not cross. If you have someone's private information - keep it to yourself.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Creating this documentation will be an ongoing process. Mistakes will happen, so don't be afraid to report them to the moderators.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You can submit anything you find interesting for review and possible future publication. Just check if it's not already in the documentation. This will save the moderators some time.
{% endhint %}

#### Some technical details:

All documentation will be published here on GitBook and backed up by bi-directional integration with GitHub.

GitBook doesn't have a mobile app, so to create a mobile-friendly version of this documentation, it will also be published on Notion.
