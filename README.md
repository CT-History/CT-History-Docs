# ðŸ“œ CT History

Okay, guys, hear me out. I have a serious question.

The culture and lore of CT is something truly unique. There have been hundreds, if not thousands, of amazing and hilarious moments.

What happens when we inevitably dump our bags on the institutions, we all find wives and retire?

With our deteriorating brain cells, how long will we really remember all this?

[Smolting](https://twitter.com/inversebrah) has done a good job of archiving many of these moments on his timeline, but who knows what his real lifespan is? How much longer will he be able to keep track of everything?

Someone needs to help him structure and organise the data he's collected to turn his chaotic Twitter timeline into something readable for the future Netflix show producer.

It's time to document CT history our way, before it fades away and someone else does it years from now, completely twisting all the facts and drawing false conclusions.

If you want to be a part of this project, contact me. Open your bookmarks, go through your old screenshots, open that old folder of memes.

Tell me any interesting stories or events you remember. I will coordinate the fact-checking, documenting, organising and publishing of the data collected.

Think of all the moments that make you feel nostalgic.
